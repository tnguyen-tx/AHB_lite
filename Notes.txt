Topic:	Single register AHB register map inteface.

Descriptioin:
	This package adds a new module called "MYIP" to the original example2 design.
	"MYIP" has a device with AHB slave IF and a single register for read and write. 
	The address for this register is 0xC210_0000.

	MYIP is modified from AHBSSRAM.v. It removed all unecessary I/Os and logics for 
	SSRAM access. 

Extending this to your homework:
	Extend the number of registers to fit your IP core's I/O requirement. In order to
	handle multiple registers, you'll need to decode the address to
	(case statement for address) access these internal registers.

That's all I can help.
Good luck!!
